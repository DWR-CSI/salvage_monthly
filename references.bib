	abstract = {Effective conservation and management of migratory species requires accurate identification of unique populations, even as they mix along their migratory corridors. While telemetry has historically been used to study migratory animal movement and habitat use patterns, genomic tools are emerging as a superior alternative in many ways, allowing large-scale application at reduced costs. Here, we demonstrate the usefulness of genomic resources for identifying single-nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) that allow fast and accurate identification of the imperiled Chinook salmon in the Great Central Valley of California. We show that 80 well-chosen loci, drawn from a pool of over 11,500 {SNPs} developed from restriction site-associated {DNA} sequencing, can accurately identify Chinook salmon runs and select populations within run. No other {SNP} panel for Central Valley Chinook salmon has been able to achieve the high accuracy of assignment we show here. This panel will greatly improve our ability to study and manage this ecologically, economically, and socially important species and demonstrates the great utility of using genomics to study migratory species.},
